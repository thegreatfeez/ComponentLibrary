# React Component Library

A custom UI component library built as part of my React learning journey. This project demonstrates advanced React concepts including reusable components, custom hooks, props management, and component composition patterns.

## 📚 Learning Context

This is a practical assignment from my React class, designed to reinforce key concepts I've learned:

- **Custom Components** - Building reusable UI elements
- **Props & PropTypes** - Component configuration and data passing
- **Custom Hooks** - Extracting and sharing component logic
- **Conditional Rendering** - Dynamic component behavior
- **Component Composition** - Flexible and maintainable component architecture
- **Styling** - CSS integration with React components
- **State Management** - Handling component state effectively

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Build 4 Core Components**: Badge, Banner, Card, and Testimonial
2. **Implement Reusability**: Create custom hooks for shared functionality
3. **Practice Design Systems**: Consistent color theming and styling
4. **Master Component Patterns**: Props, children, conditional rendering
5. **Apply Best Practices**: Clean code, proper file structure, and documentation


**Benefits:**
- Centralized color management
- Easy theme customization
- Reusable across components
- Consistent design system

## 🎨 Design System

- **Font**: Permanent Marker (Google Fonts)
- **Color Palette**: Tailwind CSS color system
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins
- **Typography**: Semantic sizing and weights
